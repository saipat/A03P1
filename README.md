# a03-prep

Assessment 3 consists of two parts: **SQL** and **ActiveRecord
Associations**. The total duration of this assessment is **75 minutes**.

The SQL part will work exactly like SQLZoo, except that
it will be done using RSpec, rather than through the web.

The ActiveRecord part of the assessment consists of a Rails
application with models and a schema. Consulting the schema, you will
write the associations that interrelate the various model classes.

## How to prepare

* Do SQL Zoo.
* Do the practice assessments, multiple times.
* Review associations in project solutions up to this point.
  * Start with `has_many` and `belongs_to` associations before moving on to any
  `has_many_through` associations
